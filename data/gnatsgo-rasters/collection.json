  "description": "This collection contains the raster data for gNATSGO. In order to use the map unit values contained in the `mukey` raster asset, you'll need to join to tables represented as Items in the [gNATSGO Tables](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/gnatsgo-tables) Collection. Many items have commonly used values encoded in additional raster assets.\n\nThe gridded National Soil Survey Geographic Database (gNATSGO) is a USDA-NRCS Soil & Plant Science Division (SPSD) composite database that provides complete coverage of the best available soils information for all areas of the United States and Island Territories. It was created by combining data from the Soil Survey Geographic Database (SSURGO), State Soil Geographic Database (STATSGO2), and Raster Soil Survey Databases (RSS) into a single seamless ESRI file geodatabase.\n\nSSURGO is the SPSD flagship soils database that has over 100 years of field-validated detailed soil mapping data. SSURGO contains soils information for more than 90 percent of the United States and island territories, but unmapped land remains. STATSGO2 is a general soil map that has soils data for all of the United States and island territories, but the data is not as detailed as the SSURGO data. The Raster Soil Surveys (RSSs) are the next generation soil survey databases developed using advanced digital soil mapping methods.\n\nThe gNATSGO database is composed primarily of SSURGO data, but STATSGO2 data was used to fill in the gaps. The RSSs are newer product with relatively limited spatial extent.  These RSSs were merged into the gNATSGO after combining the SSURGO and STATSGO2 data. The extent of RSS is expected to increase in the coming years.\n\nSee the [official documentation](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/soils/survey/geo/?cid=nrcseprd1464625)",

Soil components with hydricrating = 'YES' are considered PWSL. Soil components with hydricrating = “NO” are not PWSL. Soil components with hydricrating = 'UNRANKED' are tested using other attributes, and will be considered PWSL if any of the following conditions are met: drainagecl = 'Poorly drained' or 'Very poorly drained' or the localphase or the otherph data fields contain any of the phrases \"drained\" or \"undrained\" or \"channeled\" or \"protected\" or \"ponded\" or \"flooded\". If these criteria do not determine the PWSL for a component and hydricrating = 'UNRANKED', then the map unit will be classified as PWSL if the map unit name contains any of the phrases \"drained\" or \"undrained\" or \"channeled\" or \"protected\" or \"ponded\" or \"flooded\". For version 1 (pwsl1), waterbodies are identified as \"999\" when map unit names match a list of terms that identify water or intermittent water or map units have a sum of the comppct_r for \"Water\" that is 80% or greater. NULL values are presented where data are incomplete or not available."

Root zone depth influences soil productivity significantly. Soil component horizon criteria for root-limiting depth include: presence of hard bedrock, soft bedrock, a fragipan, a duripan, sulfuric material, a dense layer, a layer having a pH of less than 3.5, or a layer having an electrical conductivity of more than 12 within the component soil profile. If no root-restricting zone is identified, a depth of 150 cm is used to approximate the root zone depth (Dobos et al., 2012). Root zone depth is computed for all map unit major earthy components (weighted average).
