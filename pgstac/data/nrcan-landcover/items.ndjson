In response to this need, the Canada Centre for Remote Sensing (CCRS) has generated a 30 m land cover map of Canada for the base year 2010, as well as this 2015 land cover map. This land cover dataset is also the Canadian contribution to the 30 m spatial resolution 2015 Land Cover Map of North America, which is produced by Mexican, American and Canadian government institutions under a collaboration called the North American Land Change Monitoring System (NALCMS). This land cover dataset for Canada is produced using observation from Operational Land Imager (OLI) Landsat sensor. An accuracy assessment based on 806 randomly distributed samples shows that land cover data produced with this new approach has achieved 79.90% accuracy with no marked spatial disparities.  \\\\n  \\\\n  - [Land Cover of Canada - Cartographic Product Collection](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/11990a35-912e-4002-b197-d57dd88836d7)","label:tasks":["classification"],"end_datetime":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","sci:citation":"Latifovic, R., 2019.
